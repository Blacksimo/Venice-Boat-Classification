# Venice Boat Classification
The purpose of this project is to develop a valuable tool to recognize and classify different categories of boats navigating in the city of Venice (Italy) from pictures, through the use of a Convolutional Neural Network.

In order to train the above-mentioned network, weâ€™re taking advantage of the dataset MarDCT, provided by Sapienza University of Rome. It contains 4.774 images for the training set and 1.969 for the test set, from 24 different categories of boats.
